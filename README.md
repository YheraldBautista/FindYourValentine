# FindYourValentine
Valentine's day is near. Many years in a row, I've been single on Valentine's Day. So naturally, this year, I coded a Tinder bot that will try to do the impossible... Find me a Valentine.

I used the Bumble API in hopes that maybe one of the Valentines would be my special someone this February 14th. :)


1. install pynder, client for the Tinder API.
